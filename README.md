- People analytics DMI project
The People Analytics DMI project analyzed the competencies of individuals in the WAIT database to enhance team efficiency. Using machine learning clustering algorithms, we segmented members into distinct groups, drawing actionable insights on how competencies evolved. This analysis optimized team composition and performance, leading to more effective human resource management and the creation of high-performing project teams.

- Loan approval project
The Loan Approval Classification project developed a machine learning model to classify loan approvals using a Kaggle dataset of loan applicants. This dataset included demographic details, financial status, and employment history, providing a comprehensive view of applicants. The goal was to build a predictive model to assess the risk associated with loan applicants, aiding financial institutions in making informed loan approval decisions.
